# Changelog

## [0.2.6] — 2026-05-21

### Added
- QR card type classification: new `qr_card_type` enum (`RAW_BAG`, `VARIETY_PACK`, `WORKFLOW_TRAVELER`, `UNKNOWN`) and `card_type` column on `qr_cards` (migration 0040). Existing cards with `bag-card-*` tokens are backfilled to `RAW_BAG`; `variety-pack-*` tokens to `VARIETY_PACK`.
- `scripts/repair-qr-inventory.ts` — idempotent script to seed physical card inventory: bag-card-1..200 (RAW_BAG) + variety-pack-1..5 (VARIETY_PACK). Run via `npm run repair:qr-inventory`.
- QR validation helpers in `lib/db/queries/qr-cards.ts`: `listAvailableRawBagQrCards`, `listAvailableVarietyPackQrCards`, `getNextAvailableRawBagQrCard`, `validateQrCardUsableForRawBag`, `validateQrCardUsableForVarietyPack` — each enforces type + status eligibility rules with exact rejection reasons.
- 14 unit tests for QR card validation helpers.

### Improved
- QR Card Management UI: per-type summary tiles (Raw bag / Variety pack), new filter tabs (All / Raw bag / Variety pack / Assigned / Idle / Retired / Unknown), type badge on each row, scan token shown in row, search includes scan token, print button scoped to idle raw bag cards.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- PO line sync: `upsertLines` now skips lines whose Zoho status is `received`, `not_receivable`, or any unknown value. Only `to_be_received` and `partially_received` lines are inserted/updated in `po_lines`.
- Sync POs banner now shows full detail: "N POs · N details · N lines synced" so operators can confirm detail fetches and line upserts at a glance.

### Added
- TODO comment in po-sync.ts marking where `is_tablet_po` scoping will plug in once Zoho Integration exposes the normalized field.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- PO sync now fetches line items: `syncPurchaseOrdersFromZoho()` calls the Zoho detail endpoint for every OPEN/RECEIVING PO and upserts `po_lines` rows keyed on `zohoLineItemId`. Lines auto-match to local `tabletTypeId` via `tablet_types.zoho_item_id`; unmatched lines store the Zoho item name + id in `notes`. Sync result now reports `lineUpserted`, `lineSkipped`, and `detailsFetched`.
- Raw-bag intake: empty-state message now directs users to the Zoho sync button rather than the inbound page.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-21

### Improved
- Packaging output page: MetricCard now supports `variant="light"` for the admin UI. All metric cards on the Packaging output page now use white/light-surface cards with proper contrast instead of dark `bg-slate-900` tiles. Floor-board MetricCards unchanged (still `variant="dark"` by default).
- Packaging output page: "Unknown" product label replaced with muted "—" dash in queue tables.
- Packaging output page: Added conditional note in queue section header when product name is blank (bag not yet mapped via PRODUCT_MAPPED event).
- Packaging output page: Removed spurious italic from empty-state text and null dash spans.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-21

### Added
- Zoho Integration inventory read client (`lib/zoho/inventory-service-client.ts`) — four GET functions: list purchase orders, get PO detail, search items, list warehouses. Injectable env/fetchImpl/timeoutMs; 32 tests.
- PO sync service (`lib/zoho/po-sync.ts`) — `syncPurchaseOrdersFromZoho()` upserts `purchase_orders` from Zoho via SELECT-then-INSERT/UPDATE. Terminal-status guard (RECEIVED/CLOSED/CANCELLED rows never downgraded). Duplicate zohoPoId guard. 17 tests.
- Receive-eligible status mapping: Zoho `issued`→`OPEN`, `partially_received`→`RECEIVING`, `received`→`RECEIVED`, `draft`→`DRAFT`, `cancelled`→`CANCELLED`.
- Admin sync action (`syncPurchaseOrdersFromZohoAction`) on the raw-bags receiving page — admin-gated, revalidates PO list on success.
- "Sync POs from Zoho" button in the raw-bags badge strip — shows fetched/upserted counts and errors inline.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- PO dropdown in raw bag intake now sorts newest-first (`openedAt` desc) so most recent POs appear at the top.

### Improved
- PO option labels include vendor name and status badge for clarity.
- Badge strip shows count of open/receiving POs and a hint that draft/closed/cancelled POs are hidden.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- PO dropdown in raw bag intake now filters out CLOSED and CANCELLED purchase orders.
- Machines & stations page: renamed "Cards / turn" column to "Units / cycle" to be accurate across all machine kinds (blister, bottle, sticker, sealing, packaging).

### Improved
- QR cards management: added status breakdown stat tiles (idle / assigned / retired counts), live search by label or UUID, and status filter tabs.
- Finished lots genealogy section: improved table layout and readability.
- Reports page: material burn section visual improvements including totals row.
- Admin footer: now shows semver version (`v0.2.0`) alongside git SHA and build date.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-18
