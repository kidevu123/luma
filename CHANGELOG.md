# Changelog

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-21

### Improved
- Packaging output page: MetricCard now supports `variant="light"` for the admin UI. All metric cards on the Packaging output page now use white/light-surface cards with proper contrast instead of dark `bg-slate-900` tiles. Floor-board MetricCards unchanged (still `variant="dark"` by default).
- Packaging output page: "Unknown" product label replaced with muted "—" dash in queue tables.
- Packaging output page: Added conditional note in queue section header when product name is blank (bag not yet mapped via PRODUCT_MAPPED event).
- Packaging output page: Removed spurious italic from empty-state text and null dash spans.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-21

### Added
- Zoho Integration inventory read client (`lib/zoho/inventory-service-client.ts`) — four GET functions: list purchase orders, get PO detail, search items, list warehouses. Injectable env/fetchImpl/timeoutMs; 32 tests.
- PO sync service (`lib/zoho/po-sync.ts`) — `syncPurchaseOrdersFromZoho()` upserts `purchase_orders` from Zoho via SELECT-then-INSERT/UPDATE. Terminal-status guard (RECEIVED/CLOSED/CANCELLED rows never downgraded). Duplicate zohoPoId guard. 17 tests.
- Receive-eligible status mapping: Zoho `issued`→`OPEN`, `partially_received`→`RECEIVING`, `received`→`RECEIVED`, `draft`→`DRAFT`, `cancelled`→`CANCELLED`.
- Admin sync action (`syncPurchaseOrdersFromZohoAction`) on the raw-bags receiving page — admin-gated, revalidates PO list on success.
- "Sync POs from Zoho" button in the raw-bags badge strip — shows fetched/upserted counts and errors inline.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- PO dropdown in raw bag intake now sorts newest-first (`openedAt` desc) so most recent POs appear at the top.

### Improved
- PO option labels include vendor name and status badge for clarity.
- Badge strip shows count of open/receiving POs and a hint that draft/closed/cancelled POs are hidden.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- PO dropdown in raw bag intake now filters out CLOSED and CANCELLED purchase orders.
- Machines & stations page: renamed "Cards / turn" column to "Units / cycle" to be accurate across all machine kinds (blister, bottle, sticker, sealing, packaging).

### Improved
- QR cards management: added status breakdown stat tiles (idle / assigned / retired counts), live search by label or UUID, and status filter tabs.
- Finished lots genealogy section: improved table layout and readability.
- Reports page: material burn section visual improvements including totals row.
- Admin footer: now shows semver version (`v0.2.0`) alongside git SHA and build date.
